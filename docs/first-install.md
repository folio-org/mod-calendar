# First Install

This is similar to [test-deployment.md](test-deployment.md), however, this document is intended for
the first deployment onto a server with an existing, older `mod-calendar` running.

## Declare Module

The module descriptor will convey the information about the module to Okapi, as described in
`build-process.md`.

```sh
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @target/ModuleDescriptor.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/modules
```

This should return successfully (2xx) and echo back the newly defined module.

## Build Module

To build the image, use:

```sh
docker build -t docker.ci.folio.org/mod-calendar .
```

Please note that the `.` is part of the command.

If your IDE does not do any compilation itself, you will likely need to run `mvn install` first.

## Deploy Module

Before the module can be deployed, the name of the node must be known. The following will find it
(usually `localhost` or, on Vagrant, `10.0.2.15`):

```sh
curl -w '\n' -X GET \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/nodes
```

Once this is placed into the generated `target/DeploymentDescriptor.json`, we can deploy it onto the
node:

```sh
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d @target/DeploymentDescriptor.json \
  http://localhost:9130/_/discovery/modules
```

If this fails, this means there was an issue deploying the module. You can examine the logs using
`docker logs --follow -n 100 CONTAINER_ID`, where the container ID is found with `docker ps`. Please
note that only the startup of the module will be in the main Okapi logs; after this, the module logs
are only found in its container.

## Tenant Enabling

This is the step where things diverge from the base deployment instructions as, instead of just
installing the module, we want to also disable the previous mod-calendar.

This can be done using (where `2.0.0` is the new version, `1.12.0` is the
[old module version](http://localhost:3000/settings/about), and `diku` is the tenant to enable the
module on):

```sh
curl -w '\n' -X POST -D - \
  -H "Content-type: application/json" \
  -d '[{"id":"mod-calendar-2.0.0-SNAPSHOT","action":"enable"},{"id":"mod-calendar-1.14.0-SNAPSHOT.123","action":"disable"}]' \
  http://localhost:9130/_/proxy/tenants/diku/install
```
