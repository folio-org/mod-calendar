      comment: Add names to exceptions
      # Previous version specified to add the name column after calendar_id
      # however, this is not supported in postgres.  Old liquibase ignored
      # this silently, however, newer liquibase versions fail entirely.
      # To fix this, we removed the offending parameter below; however,
      # existing installations will see the changeset differs, so we must add
      # this. The typical solution of rolling forward would not work here
      # since the changeset with offending parameter would fail outright.
